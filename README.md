**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

FitPik (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the FitPik mobile application (the “App”).

By using FitPik, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 1. Overview

FitPik is a personal wardrobe and styling application designed to help users organize their closet, plan outfits, and generate AI-powered suggestions.

We prioritize privacy and minimize data collection. Most user data is stored locally on your device.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide

FitPik may collect and store the following information **locally on your device**:

- Photos of clothing items
- Tags and style preferences
- Outfit combinations
- Calendar entries and events
- Packing trip data
- AI chat messages (if applicable)
- Optional API keys (if you choose to provide your own)

This data is stored on your device and is not automatically transmitted to us.

---

### B. Camera & Photo Library Access

FitPik requests access to:

- **Camera** — to allow you to take photos of clothing items.
- **Photo Library** — to upload existing photos.

Photos are stored locally on your device within the app’s secure storage and are not uploaded to external servers unless required for AI processing (see Section 5).

---

### C. Location Data

FitPik may request access to:

- **Location services (when in use)** — to retrieve weather data for outfit suggestions and packing recommendations.

Location data is used only to fetch weather information and is not stored or shared.

---

## 3. Local Storage

FitPik primarily stores user data locally using on-device storage technologies.

This includes:

- Closet inventory
- Outfit data
- Calendar logs
- Packing lists
- Style preferences

We do not maintain a central database of your wardrobe or personal information.

If you delete the app, your locally stored data may be permanently removed unless backed up via your device’s operating system.

---

## 4. AI Services & Third-Party APIs

FitPik may integrate with third-party AI providers (such as Google Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic Claude) to generate styling suggestions, packing lists, and chat responses.

Depending on configuration:

### Option A — App-Provided AI Access
If FitPik provides AI access directly:
- User inputs (such as outfit requests or trip details) may be transmitted to the selected AI provider to generate responses.
- We do not store AI conversation data on our servers.

### Option B — User-Provided API Keys
If you choose to provide your own API key:
- Your API key is stored securely in your device’s encrypted keychain.
- API requests are made directly from your device to the selected AI provider.
- We do not have access to your API key.
- You are responsible for managing usage and billing associated with your API key.

Please review the privacy policies of third-party AI providers for more information:

- Google Gemini: https://ai.google.dev/
- OpenAI: https://openai.com/privacy
- Anthropic: https://www.anthropic.com/privacy

## 5. Weather Data

FitPik uses third-party weather APIs (such as Open-Meteo) to retrieve forecast data.

- Weather requests may include latitude/longitude coordinates.
- No personal identifiers are sent.
- Weather data is used only to enhance outfit and packing suggestions.

---

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data.

We do not share your wardrobe data with advertisers or analytics providers.

Data may be transmitted only when:
- Requesting AI-generated responses
- Fetching weather information
- Complying with legal obligations

---

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information:

- Local encrypted storage where supported by the operating system
- Secure Keychain storage for API keys
- No unnecessary cloud storage
- No background data transmission

However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

---

## 8. Data Retention

Since most data is stored locally:

- Your data remains on your device until you delete it.
- Deleting the app may delete stored data.
- Optional backup/export features (if enabled) are controlled by you.

We do not maintain centralized user data archives.

---

## 9. Children’s Privacy

FitPik is not directed toward children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will address the situation.

---

## 10. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:

- Access your data
- Correct your data
- Delete your data
- Restrict processing

Since most data is stored locally, you may exercise these rights directly within the app by editing or deleting your data.

---

## 11. International Users

FitPik may be used globally. If AI providers or APIs process data outside your country, it is subject to the privacy policies and data protection standards of those providers.

---

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

Updates will be reflected by a revised “Last Updated” date.

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
